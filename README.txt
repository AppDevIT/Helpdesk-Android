This application is intended for learning purposes and IT support only.

Within the hierarchy of this application, I have created a name scheme which goes like this:

The program starts with MainActivity and then moves onto a list of other possible classes to enter (e.g. knowledgebase1, emailing, etc).

Knowledgebase1 class is the "top" of most of the other classes. 

If the class ends in a "activity1", then it is the "main" of the sub-branch in the hierarchy. 
For example, healthy_activity1 is the passage into all of the other healthy_activity classes.
If they end in a normal name, then it is the lowest node in the tree.

One thing to keep in mind, I had major issues creating a class which contained an uppercase letter, for some reason or another,
would not compile correctly. Something to keep in mind when dealing with this application. 

Please try to keep this naming scheme in mind when adding anything to this application.

For the sake of simplicity, I created and used only one webview xml file so that way developers don't have to work with 100 of them.
